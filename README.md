# Analysis notebooks for the presentation "Una questione di qualit√†: l'uso dei connettivi nelle produzioni scritte di studenti italofoni".

These analyses have been presented at University of Basel, on 13-14 November 2024.

The research questions are:

* Does the use of connectives (in terms of number of tokens, RTTR, sophistication and range) change as a function of training in writing?
* Does number of connectives, variety (RTTR) or sophistication of connectives used correlate with holistic judgements of textual coherence?
* Does accuracy in using connectives correlates with holistic judgements of textual coherence?
  * If so, which are the most 'problematic' connectives?
  * Which are the most 'problematic' discourse relations?

This repo contains two analysis notebooks:
* `RQ1.ipynb` answers research question 1 and extends analysis done for Bienati & Frey (in print) and available at https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/commul/lca/lcr22_itaca
* `RQ2_3.ipynb` contains code to answer research questions 2 and 3.

And a python script:
* `process_ratings.py` cleans the holistic ratings of textual coherence. It is recommended to run the `process.ratings.py` in advance so to have all materials ready for the analysis.

To run the analysis, you need to have installed R, Python and Jupyter Notebooks on you laptop.
